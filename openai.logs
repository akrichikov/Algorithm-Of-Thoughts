        a search process, highlighted by markers ‘1’,..., ‘3’ as “first operations” guiding subtree exploration for the OBJECTIVE, 
        focus on the third subtree exploration. Produce prospective search steps (e.g., the subtree exploration ‘5. 11 + 1’) 
        and evaluates potential subsequent steps to either progress
        towards a solution or retrace to another viable subtree then be very thorough 
        and think atomically then provide solutions for those subtasks, 
        then return the definitive end result and then summarize it


        ########## OBJECTIVE
        

Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. When
considering the next steps, do not choose operations that will result in a
negative or fractional number. In order to help with the calculations, the
numbers in the parenthesis represent the numbers that are left after the
operations and they are in descending order.
Another thing we do is when there are only two numbers left in the parenthesis, we
check whether we can arrive at 24 only by using basic arithmetic operations
(+ - * /). Some examples regarding this idea:
(21 2) no
since 21 + 2 = 23, 21 - 2 = 19, 21 * 2 = 42, 21 / 2 = 10.5, none of which is equal
to 24.
(30 6) 30 - 6 = 24 yes
(8 3) 8 * 3 = 24 yes
(12 8) no
(48 2) 48 / 2 = 24 yes
Most importantly, do not give up, all the numbers that will be given has indeed a
solution.
